This Genesys Cloud Developer Blueprint provides instructions for building a messaging translation assistant, which uses the AWS Translate service to allow customers and agents to chat in their preferred languages. The messaging translation assistant automatically translates everything in the right side of the Interactions panel in real-time, including canned responses. This solution supports web messaging interactions. You can deploy all the components used in this solution with the Terraform Genesys Cloud CX as Code provider.
