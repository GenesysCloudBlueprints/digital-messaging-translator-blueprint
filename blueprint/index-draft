## Scenario

An organization wants to provide a real-time translation for web chat and web messaging that allows customers and agents to have a conversation using their preferred languages:

1. **The customer sends a message in their preferred language.** The agent receives the customer's incoming message in its original language.

2. **The agent opens the messaging translation interaction widget.** The widget uses the agent's preferred language, as configured in Genesys Cloud, to display the appropriate message translation. 

3. **The agent sends a message in their preferred language.** The customer receives the agent's response translated in the customer's preferred language.

## Solution components

* **Genesys Cloud CX** - A suite of Genesys Cloud services for enterprise-grade communications, collaboration, and contact center management. In this solution, you use an Architect inbound message flow, a Genesys Cloud integration, a Genesys Cloud queue, web messaging configuration, and web messaging deployment.
* **Architect flows** - A flow in Architect, a drag and drop web-based design tool, dictates how Genesys Cloud handles inbound or outbound interactions.  In this solution, an inbound message flow provides the routing layer that gets the customer to the right queue.
* **Interaction widget integration** - The Genesys Cloud integration that enables web apps to be embedded in an iframe within Genesys Cloud. The iframe  appears only on specified interaction types and to specified agents. For this solution, Genesys Cloud uses the Interaction Widget integration to show translated web chat and web messages to the customer.
* **Web messaging and Messenger** - The Genesys Cloud messaging platform that enables asynchronous conversations and a unified agent and supervisor experience across all Genesys Cloud messaging channels. Messenger is the predefined message window that customers use to communicate with bots and agents. 
* **CX as Code** - A Genesys Cloud Terraform provider that provides an interface for declaring core Genesys Cloud objects.
* **AWS IAM** - Identity and Access Management that controls access to AWS resources such as services or features. In this solution, you set the permissions to allow the messaging translation assistant to access Amazon Translate and the AWS for JavaScript SDK.
* **Amazon Translate** - A translation service that enables cross-lingual communication between users of an application. Amazon Translate is the translation service used in this solution.

### Software development kits (SDKs)

* **Genesys Cloud Platform API SDK** - Client libraries used to simplify application integration with Genesys Cloud by handling low-level HTTP requests. In this solution, this SDK is used for the initial chat and messaging interaction between agent and customer.
* **AWS for JavaScript SDK** - This SDK enables developers to build and deploy applications that use AWS services. This solution uses the JavaScript API to enable messaging translation in an agent's browser and it uses the inside Node.js applications to enable the messaging translation interaction widget on the server where Genesys Cloud runs.

## Implementation steps

### Download the repository containing the project files

1. Clone the [digital-messaging-translator-blueprint repository](https://github.com/GenesysCloudBlueprints/digital-messaging-translator-blueprint "Opens the digital-messaging-translator-blueprint repository in GitHub").

### Set up AWS Translate

1. Create an IAM user for the application. For more information, see [IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html "Opens IAM users") in the AWS documentation.
2. Add a policy to the IAM that grants full access to the AWS Translate service. For more information, see [Managing IAM policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html "Opens Managing IAM policies") in the AWS documentation.
3. Create an access key for the IAM user. For more information, see [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html "Opens Managing access keys for IAM users") in the AWS documentation.
4. Write down the access key and secret.
5. Create an .ENV file in the directory folder and provide values for the following variables: `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

  :::primary
  **Tip**: Start with the sample.env file in this blueprint solution, rename it to `.env` and provide your org-specific details.
  :::

### Set up Genesys Cloud

1. To run this project using the Terraform provider, open a Terminal window and set the following environment variables:

 * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_ID` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential grant Id that CX as Code executes against. 
 * `GENESYSCLOUD_OAUTHCLIENT_SECRET` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud client credential secret that CX as Code executes against. 
 * `GENESYSCLOUD_REGION` - This variable is the Genesys Cloud region in your organization.

2. Run Terraform in the Terminal window where you set the environment variables. 

### Configure your Terraform build

In the blueprint/terraform/dev.auto.tfvars file, set the following values, which are specific to your Genesys Cloud organization:

* `environment` - The value of this free-form field combines with the prefix value to define the names of various Genesys Cloud artifacts. For example, if you set the environment name to be `dev` and the prefix to be `web-messaging` your Genesys Cloud group, queue, Messenger configuration, and Messenger deployment will all begin with `dev-web-messaging`.
* `prefix`- The value of this free-form field combines with the environment value to define the names of various Genesys Cloud artifacts.
* `email` - This value is the email account that you use with Genesys Cloud. It will be used to assign you to the appropriate Genesys Cloud group and queue.

The following is an example of the dev.auto.tfvars file.

```
environment            = "dev"
prefix                 = "web-messaging"
email                  = "test-email@company.com"
```

### Run Terraform

You are now ready to run this blueprint solution for your organization. 

1. Change to the docs/terraform folder and issue these commands:

* `terraform plan` - This command executes a trial run against your Genesys Cloud organization and shows you a list of all the Genesys Cloud resources it creates. Review this list and make sure that you are comfortable with the plan before continuing to the second step.

* `terraform apply --auto-approve` - This command creates and deploys the necessary objects in your Genesys Cloud account. The --auto-approve flag completes the required approval step before the command creates the objects.

After the `terraform apply --auto-approve` command completes, you should see the output of the entire run along with the number of objects successfully created by Terraform. Keep these points in mind:

*  This project assumes you are running using a local Terraform backing state, which means that the `tfstate` files are created in the same folder where you run the project. Terraform does not recommend using local Terraform backing state files unless you run from a desktop and are comfortable with the deleted files.

* As long as you keep your local Terraform backing state projects, you can tear down this blueprint solution by changing to the `docs/terraform` folder and issuing a `terraform destroy --auto-approve` command. This command destroys all objects currently managed by the local Terraform backing state.

### Additional configurations

After you have created the Genesys Cloud objects, use a Messenger deployment to add a Messenger chat window to your website.

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Message** > **Messenger Deployments** > **dev-web-messaging-deployment**.
2. Under **Deploy your snippet**, click **Copy to Clipboard** to copy the snippet. Paste the snippet in the `<head>` tag of the web pages where you want the Messenger to appear.

You also need to update the config file found in /docs/scripts/config.js to use the OAuth client.

1. Navigate to **Admin** > **Integrations** > **OAuth** > **Web Messages Implicit Client**.
2. Add the client ID from your OAuth client and specify the region for your Genesys Cloud organization, for example, `mypurecloud.ie` or `mypurecloud.com.au`.

### Host and run the Node.js app server

1. Verify that you are running Node.js v14.15.4 or later. 
  * To verify your version, run `node-v`.
  * To upgrade, run `nvm install 14.15.4`.
  * To install the latest version, run `npm install -g n latest`.

2. Switch to the folder where the files for your messaging translation assistant are located. In the local node-modules folder run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. To run the server locally, run `node run-local.js`.
